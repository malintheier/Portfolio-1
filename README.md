# 🎓 Frontend Portfolio – Malin

This is my personal portfolio website built as part of my frontend development studies at Noroff. The site showcases three selected projects and reflects my progress in coding, design, and documentation.

## 📌 About the Project

This portfolio is a single-page application (SPA) built using only HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript – no frameworks. It includes:

- Project cards with thumbnails, titles, short descriptions, and links
- Responsive layout and semantic markup
- Updated CV and cover letter
- Links to GitHub repositories and live demos

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- HTML5  
- CSS3  
- JavaScript (Vanilla)  
- Figma (for design planning)  
- Git & GitHub (version control and documentation)
